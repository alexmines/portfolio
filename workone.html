        <p>The goal of this project was to redesign a past project. By redesigning my past work I was able to think further about how I could make this attractive to the public. </p>
        <h3>Overall</h3>
        <p>The project is innovative and gets the public interested because it is using different ways to lure people in. People are often curious about events but get lazy about finding the information or even typing in a website or social media handle.With a quick and easy QR code scan that anyone can do from their phone people can easily get all the information at the tip of their fingers. It is saved into their phone for future reference. This method also gets people talking.</p>
        <h3>Qr</h3>
        <p>Tracking how many people scan the poster and tickets can let businesses calculate the amount of people reached for the event. This is innovative because once the design is complete the company can check-in on the success of their event. Having a physical amount of interactions can better the next event for the brand which is great for business. Not many people use QR codes for events so having one for a fashion show is very different and will get people to scan it if they’re curious.</p>
        <h3>Set</h3>
        <p>The pieces of this event branding are still a set even if they don’t have the same colours, design and illustration. Each piece has two illustrations repeating. They relate back to the actual event (Fashion). Having illustrations instead of photography brings a fun and playful tone to the event rather than serious and moody which can push people away. Each main piece (print poster and the ticket) has a piece that goes with it and has the opposite colour scheme. This allows all four pieces to go well together and make sure people know they are from the same set.</p>
        <h3>Colour</h3>
        <p>The pieces vary from teal shades, to deep yellows and salmon pinks. This gives them playful, young tones. Every piece includes different variations of these shades in different ways. Some being line art, solid and backgrounds.</p>
